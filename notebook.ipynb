During the lessons, we have not had time to discuss machine learning techniques and classification methods in detail, so in this exercise you will be using library implementations as “black box” methods.* <br>\n\n*Run all classification experiments on both of the tasks you’ve chosen (one binary and one multi-class task). Evaluate your different classifiers on the validation set and report relevant evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision/recall/F-score).* <br>\n\n*As a baseline, start with the sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier in a logistic regression configuration (loss=’log’) using bag of words features. Then run at least additional experiments trying to improve your initial scores by any means you can think of. Try out at least 4 different methods. Usually you will need to run several experiments for each methods to test different parameter values. Here are some settings in scikit-learn that you could experiment with:*",
